This is Project 1 for CS 425. 
Python Script info:
  DataCleaner.py: This script opens a given file. It then turns the lines of a file into a list where the entries of the list
                  are the lines of the file. It then uses the method CleanLine to clean the individual lines. It takes a line
                  It first expandes the tabs. Then The method splits the line into a vector of strings by spaces. Clean line 
                  also removes empty strings leaving the ,line as a vector of the words that were in the line and returns the vector.
                  DataCleaner returns a vector of vectors where each row is a line from the file and each row is a vector of the words in 
                  the file.

  DataManipulation.py: This script has a lot of methods for grabing, modifying and manipulating data
  
  Regression.py: This script has a lot of methods for performing linear regression analysis and testing
  
  LinearRegression.py: This script calls on all the other files to perform linear regression as a machin learning technique to predict one
                        of the columns found in the given data
                        
Other Files:
        CarData.txt: Contains data for 398 different cars
